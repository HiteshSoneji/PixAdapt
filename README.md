# PixAdapt: A novel approach to adaptive image encryption

In this project, the process of image encryption is being re-engineered to calculate the fitness of encrypted image using UACI and adapting the respective parameters using genetic hill climb or simulated annealing. Pseudorandom numbers have been generated using the linear feedback shift register and chaos-based maps such as the Logistic map, Rossler map, Henon map and Tent map.

The work has been published in Elsevier's - Chaos, Solitons and Fractals: the interdisciplinary journal of Nonlinear Science, and Non-equilibrium and Complex Phenomena (Impact factor: 9.992, SCIE & Scopus Q1)
